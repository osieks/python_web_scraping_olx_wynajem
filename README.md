Python code for scraping data from olx www.olx.pl/nieruchomosci/mieszkania/wynajem/gliwice with specific search filters.
Additionally going into each listing and getting data from the inside. 
Mainly done because price in the listing doesn't include administration cost that is shown once clicked on listing.
